Hi I’m **Sidhanth**—a full-stack developer from India obsessed with shipping clean, modern products. Right now I’m building **[0byte](https://www.0byte.tech/)**, a Solana-powered “SSL for AI content,” while leveling up on Web3 and large-language-model chops. My toolkit runs the gamut from classic Web2 React/Next.js stacks to on-chain Web3 workflows, and I love wrangling the Solana SDK to turn ambitious ideas into scalable, decentralized reality. I share what I learn on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sidhanthpandey), so feel free to dive in—or just ping me about React, Next.js, or anything dev-life at <sidh.pan98@gmail.com>.
